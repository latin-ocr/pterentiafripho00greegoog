THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 3¹

Ga. How does it come about?

PH. It’s because we never set traps lor the hawks and
kites that really hurt us ; it 's only for birds that don’t hurt
that traps are set. There 's something to be made out ol
them, but on others it's only time thrown away. Other
people have their dangerS, from one source or another,-
people something ean be got out 0f; but everybody knows
that I've got nothing to lose. But perhaps you ’ll say
that they 'll convict me and take me home to hold me
there. Oh, no ; they don’t want to keep a ravenous fellow
like me; they dou't want to do good lor evil, and that 's ¹
where they ’re wise, I think. ’

GE. Well, he can't ever thank you as much as you

deserve.

PH. Not quite so. Nobody ever can thank his patron as
much as he deserves. Think ol iti You come scot sree to his
dinner, all perlumed and shining from the bath, with a heart
l'ree lrom care, when he ’s drowned with worry and eaten up
with experrses. While everything’s done to your liking,
he 's snarling. You can laugh, drink your wine besore
him, take the higher seat; and thena puzzling banquet 's
spread.

GE. What ’s that?

ΡΗ. That’s when you ’re puzzled what to help yoursels
to first. Now, when you come to reckon up how nice all
this is and how much it costs, are n’t you obliged to think
your host a god incarnate right before your eyes?

Ga. Here ’s the old man; mind what you ’re about; the
first onset is always the fiercest. If you stand that, you
may afterwards make play as you like.
