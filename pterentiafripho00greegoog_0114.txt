THE PHORMlO OF TERENCE.

CH. ls n’t she a thorough lady though, as I told you?

DE. Through and through. We must now find Phormio
as soon as possible and get our thirty ducats away from
him before he makes ducks and drakes of thern.

ΡΗ. (coming forword.) l'll just see whether Demipho ,

is at home, so as to - DE. Ah, we were just going to see
you, Phormio. PH. On the same old errand, perhaps?

DE. Yes, to be sure. PH. Isupposed so. But what

made you think it necessary to come? DE. Oh pooh!
· PH. Did you think Ι would n't do what Ι had once under-
taken? See here, however poor Ι may be, there 's one thing
I've always been particular about, and that is to keep my
word. And so Ι came to tell you this, Demipho, that l'm
all ready. Give me my wile whenever you wish. Ihave
put off all my other business, and properly enough too,
when Ι saw how very bent you were upon it.

DE. But Chremes here has persuaded me not to give
her to you. ‘Why, what will Mrs. Grundy say,' says he, ‘if
you do that? A while ago, when you could have done it
decently, you did n’t release her. To turn her out now,
divorced, is an outrage! In fact, his arguments were all
pretty much the same that you urged against me yourself a
while ago sace to sace.

PH. You're making game of me in a pretty high and
mighty way. DF„ How ’s that?

ΡΗ. How's that? Why, because I shan't be a'ble to
marry that other girl now. For how could l have the lace
to go back to the woman aster slighting her?

CH. (aside to DE.) ‘Besides Ι see that Antipho does n’t
want to let her leave him‘ -say that,

DE. Besides Ι see that my son does n't at all want to let
the woman leave him. So come over to the bank, please,
and have that money transferred to me again, Phormio.

ΡΗ. What! alterI have already paid it round among my
different creditors?
