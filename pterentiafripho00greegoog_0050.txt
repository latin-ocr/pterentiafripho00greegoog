THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

DE. Il it was n't so, you would n’t be taking his part,
Phaedria.

PH. Well, uncle, if itis a fact that Antipho has donea
wrong, regardless ol his interests or reputation, Ι have
nothing to say against his suffering as he has deserved.
But is somebody took advantage os his own cunning to
lay a snare for our youthsul innocence and has caught us
in it, isit our fault or that ol the judges? Yon know what
a habit they have os robbing the rich from envy, and giving
to the poor from pity.

GE. (aride.) Il 1 did n't know the case, I should believe
that he was telling the truth. DE. Is there a judge alive
who can possibly know your rights when you don’t answer
a word yourself, like that son of mine Ι

ΡΗ. He behaved like a young man oi good breeding.
When we got into court, he could n’t speak his plece; his
modesty struck him quite dumb then and there.

GE. (aside.) Bravo, you! but shall 1 not address the
old man at once? (going sonunrd.) Good day, master.
I’m glad you ’ve got home sale.

DE. Ha, ha! fine guardian, good day, main stay of my
house; it was in your charge that Ι left my son when 1
went away.

GE. I’ve heard you blaming us all lor ever so long when
we did n’t deserve it, and Ι least os anybody. Why, what
would you have had me‘do in the matter? the laws don’t
allow a man who ’s a slave to plead, and he can't give
evidence either.

DE. Iwaive all that, and I admit this, too, that the boy
was afraid and unsuspecting. I grant that you are a slave.
But no matter how near a relative she was, he need n’t have
married her; no, no. You should have given her a dowry,
as the law directS, and let her look out sor another hus·
band. On what account, then, did he prefer to bring home
apauper?
