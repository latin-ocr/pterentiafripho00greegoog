Tire Vnrrcsrr manuscript oi Tnnnrrcn, numbered 3868 and
written in the tenth century, is remarkable for the miniatures
with which it is illustrated. These miniatures, based to a cer·
tain extent upon earlier works, are found at the beginning of
each scene, while at the beginning of each play the masks of
the different characters are represented.

The miniatures have never before been accurately reproduced.
The complete set for the Phormio is here given from photo
graphs taken in the Vatican Library expressly for the Classical
Department of Harvard University. For the privilege of photo
graphing and publishing, the Department is d'eeply indebted to
Hrs Hocrwnss cns Pone and rothe Csnnrrrhr. Lrnnrnrnrr
of the vatican, and also returns its grateful thanks to the

Right Reverend J. J. KrrArrE, Rector of the Catholic University
of America, and to the Reverend Doctor F. Z. Roorcnn, Vice
Rector of the North American College in Rome, through whose
kind mediation the consent of the Vatican was obtained.

The number printed under each picture is that of the verse
before which the picture stands in the manuscript.
