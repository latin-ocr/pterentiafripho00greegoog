ΡΗ. (to GE. aride.) Mind your cue now ; l’m going to
touch him up pretty quick. (Aloud, to GE.) Great heavens!
does Demipho actually dercy that Phanium 's related to him?
What! Demipho says this girl ’s no relation?

GE. He says not. PH. And that he does n't know who
her father was? GE. He says not.

DE. I fancy this is the very man Ι was talking about.
Follow me. .

ΡΗ. Because the poor thing is leit in poverty, her father
is disowned and she herself is abandoned. Only see what
avarice does! GE. Yon 'll hear what you won’t like il you
insinuate anything wrong about my master.

DE. Oh, what impudence! Why, he 's come to take the
initiative by accusing me l

sellow for not knowing her lather3 of course he was a man
pretty well along, poor, working lor his living, generally
keeping in the country, where my father let him have a
sarm to cultivate. The old sellow used olten to tell me how
this kinsman ol his neglected him. But what a fine man
he wasl the best Ι ever saw in all my lile.

GE. l hope you ’ll ever see yoltrself such as you de··
scribe him.

PH. You be hanged! Νο; if Ι had n't esteemed him as
Idid‚›I should never have got into a quarrel with your
people‚ all on account os this girl that your master’s slight-
ing now in this ungentlemanlike way.
