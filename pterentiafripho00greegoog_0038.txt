howI wish it had never occurred to Phormio to urge me
to it, and that he had n't driven me, when I was in the

heat os my passion, to take this step, which was the begin·
ning os all my troubles! I should n’t have got the girl, of
course, and that would have made me wretched for some
days; but still, I should n't be suffering this everlasting
anxiety all the time,-
