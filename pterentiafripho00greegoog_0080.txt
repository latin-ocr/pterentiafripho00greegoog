kept staying and staying on in Athens, and the girl was
grown up and could n't be neglected any longer, she set
out, they told me, bag' and baggage, to come and find me.

But the skipper who brought them told me that they '

reached here sase and sound. DE. Have you heard what
has happened to my son in my absence, Chremes?

CH. That's just what makes me so undecided in my
plans. Foris I offer her in marriage to any outsider, I
must tell the whole story oi how and by whom Ι cameto

be her father. As ior you, l knew that you were as loyal '

to me as Ι am to mysell. But ii a stranger seeks alliance
with me, he will hold his tongue just so long as we are
close friends with one another; but il he breaks with me,
then he will know more than he ought to know.¹ And 1 ’m
afraid my wife may get an inkling ol all this. Is she doeS,
the only thing lest sor me to do is to give myseli a shake
and leave the house; sor I'm all I've got in the world.

DE. 1 know that is so ; that 's what makes me so anxious,
and I shall never weary os making every eisort to perform
my promise ior you.
