THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

D0. I have been putting up for some months against
my will with your promising and not performing and your
whimpering; but now Ι 've got the opposite of all this. Ι
have found aman who pays and does n't cry about it
Make way for your betters.

AN. But, by heaven, if Ι remember rightly, there was a
day set on which you were to pay him?

PH. There was.

DO. Idon't deny it, doI?

AN. Has it come yet?

Do. No, but to-day has come in ahead of it.

AN. Are n't you ashamed to be'such a fraud?

Do. Notabit if it is for my gain.

GE. Oh, you dunghilll

PH. Look here, Dorio, is this the right way to behave?

D0. It’s my way; if you like me, take me as you find
me.

AN. And you cheat him like this?

49

Do. On the contrary, Antiph0, it 's he who is cheating Ἴ

me: for he knew all along that Ι was the sort of man l am3
butI supposed that he was different. He 's taken me in,
but to him I am exactly what I was before. But never
mind; this is what I'll do. A soldier man has promised
to pay me the money to-morrow morning; now, Phaedria,
if you bring it to me before he does, I'll follow my regular
rule, that he is the better man who is first to come down
with the cash. Good-bye. (Exit, R.)
