crop ol whippings growing is you don't look out ahead. I'll

Phormio or os Nausistrata’s talk. (Exit to DEMIPHO’s.)

SCENE 11

(Entcr Duuuuao and Naus1srnnm from Cunsnus’s.)

DE. Come, then, Nausistrata, with your usual good

nature make her feel kindly towards us, so that she may '

do os her own accord what must be done. ΝΑ. Iwill.

DE. You ’ll be aiding me now with your good officeS, just
as you helped me a while ago with your purse.

NA. You 're quite welcome ; and upon my word, it 's my
husband's sault that Ι can do less than 1 might well do.

DE. Why, how is that?

ΝΑ. Because he takes wretched care os my sather’s hon-
est savings; he used regularly to get two silver talents
from those estates. How much better one man is than
another! DE. Two talents, do you say?

you out; she ’s young, you know. ,
