THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 19

ΑΝ.· I’m all abroadl GE. But that ’s just where you
must n't be now, Autiph0; for your father will think you
guilty it he sees you srightened.

PH. That 's true. AN. Ι can’t change my nature.

GE. Suppose you had to do something still harder, what
then? AN. As I can't do this, 1 could do that still less.

GE. It's no use, Phaedria; it ’s all over. Why waste our
time here for nothing? I'm off. ΡΗ. And I too (going).

AN. For mercy's sake! Suppose I make believe? will
this doi (strikes an altitude.) GE. Sillyi

AN. But just look at my face· There! is that satisfac-
tory? GE. No. AN. How about this?

GE. Pretty fair. AN. And this?

GE. That will do. Keep that, and look out that you
answer him word sor word, tit sor tat, so that he shan't
tout you with harsh language while he 's in a passion.

AN. I understand. GE. Say you were sorce'd into it,
against your will. ΡΗ. By the law-by the court. Ι

GE. Do you catch on? But who ’s that old man 1 see
down the street? it 's the governor!

AN. Ι can't face him. GE. Here! what are you doing?
where are you going, Antipho? Wait, Ι say.

AN. 1 know myself and my own fault. I leave Pha-
nium and my own life in your hands. (Runs off, R.) ’

PH. What 's going to hedone now, Geta?

GE. You'll get a wigging pretty soon, and 1 shall‘ ,
be strung up and whipped, if I'm not mistaken. But
we ought to do ourselves, Phaedria, just what we were
advising Antipho.

Pu. None os your ‘oughts.' just give me your orders
what I’m to do.

GE. Do you remember what you said long ago when we
started in with this affair, about protecting ourselves from
trouble,-that the other side's case was just, easy, sure to
win, the best in the world?
