THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

these things happen to everybody, they can happen to
you, so there should n't be anything surprising in them;
but everything that surprises you by ending well, you can
set down as so much clear gain.

GE. (acide.) Ha, Phaedria! It’s past belief how much
more ol a sage I am than my master. I have reflected on
all the troubles that master’s return will bring upon mc,-
grinding to do at the mill, floggings to get, letters to wear,
set to work on the sarm. Not a single one os them will
take me by surprise. But everything that surprises me by
ending well, Ι shall set down as so much clear gain. But
why don't you step up to him and address hIm politely to
begin with?

Da. There ’s my nephew Phaedria, I see, coming to meet
me. ΡΗ. How do you d0, uncle? DE. How do you do?
but where 's Antipho? ΡΗ. Yon 've got back safe, —

Du. Yes, yes; but answer my question.

PH. He 's well-he ’s here 3 but has everything gone to ¹

your liking? DE. lwish it had, indeed.

PH. Why, what ’s the matter?

DE. What a question, Phaedria! This is atine marriage
that you 've cooked up here while I was awayl

ΡΗ. Holloa! are you angrywith him sor that?

GE. (asido.) Fine actingl .

DE. And should n’t I be angry with him? Why, I'm
just aching to get a sight of him, so that he may find out
once for all how he's turned his good-natured old father
into a perfect savage! PH. But he has n't done anything
to make you angry, uncle. DE. Now just look at that!
birds ol a seather! they 're all in itl When you know one,
you know all. PH. It is n’t so. .

DE. When A 's in trouble, B turns up to make excuses
sor him; and when it 's B, then up eomes A. They go
partners in it. GE. (asida.) The old man ’s drawn a fine
sketch os their proceedings without knowing it.
