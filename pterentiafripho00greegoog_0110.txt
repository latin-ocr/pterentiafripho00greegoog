THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

PH. Away with your promises and out with your
news!

GE. What! you here too, Phormio?

PH. Yes, but why don’t you go ahead?

GE. Well, then, listen. After we had paid you the money
on 'Change‚ we started straight home ; then master sent me
over to see your wile.

AN. What sor?

GE. I’ll leave that out; it 's nothing to do with the case,
Antipho. Just as Ι was entering my lady's chamber, Mida,
her slave boy, ran up to me, caught me by the cloak behind
and pulled me back. I looked round and asked him what

‘ he was stopping me sor, He said that there was no admis-

sion to his mistress, ‘Sophrona has just brought in the old
man's brother Chremes and he ’s in there now with the

ladies’ says he. When Ι heard that, Ι went up soitly on
tiptoe‚ stood still, held my breath and put my ear against
the door; and Ι began to listen, trying to catch their talk

so fashion.

PH. Brav0, Geta!

GE. Whereupon I heard a most beautiful piece of busi-
, ness; so much so that, by craeky‚ I nearly shouted lor joy.

AN. What was it?

GE. Well, what do you think?

AN. I don’t know.

GE. But it ’s most marvellousl Your uncle has proved
to be your wife Phanium's father.

AN. What's that you say?

GE. He lived with her mother at Lemnos unbeknownst.

ΡΗ. You ’re dreaming! as if the girl would n’t know her
own father!

GE. Oh well, depend upon it, Phormio, there ’s some
reason sor that; but do you think that Ι, outside of the
door, could understand everything that went on between
thern inside?
