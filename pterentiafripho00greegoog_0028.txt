(Enter Dnvos n.)

DA. My particular friend and countryman, Geta, came to

see meyesterday. 1 had been owing him some small bal· ,

ance of cash on account a good while, and he asked me to
get it together. l've got it together, and I’m bringing it
to him now. The fact is, I’m told that his master’s son has
got married ; it 's sor the girl, I suppose, that he 's seraping
this testimonial together. How uniair it is that poor folks
should always be adding something to rich people’s piles!
Now here 's Geta; —the poor sellow 's been saving up out
of his rations a pint ata time, and hardly that, cheating
his own belly, and now my lady ’11 spoil him ol it all without
ever thinking what a lot oi work it took to get it. Then
besides they 'll strike him sor another testimonia] when she
has a baby; and then another too when the baby hasa
birthday, and another when it gets initiated. The mother,
of couise, will walk off with it all, and the child will be only
an excuse for the gift. But don't I see Geta?
