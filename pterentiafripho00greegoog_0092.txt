THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

CH. That ’s just what you ought to do; but make haste,
while he ’s still in the mood sor it. Is that other girl is
more pressing‚ perhaps he 'll leave us in the lurch.

GE. (asida.) You 've hit the very point.

DE. (to GE.) Take me to him, then.

GE. l’m ready.

CH. When you have attended to that, go over to my
wile's to get her to call on the girl besore she goes away.
Let her tell the girl, to prevent her from being angry‚ that
we are marrying herto Phormio, and that he is a better
match sor her, because she knows him better; and that we
have done our duty, too, and given her as large a dowry as
he asked for.

DE. What the plague does that matter to you?

CH. A good deal, Demipho. It 's not enough ior you to
do your duty ir the world does n’t approve os what you 've
done. Iwant this to take place os her own lree will, so that
she shan’t be saying that we drove her out.

DE. Well‚ I can bring all that about mysels.

CH. But a woman 's the best hand to deal with a
woman.

DE. I'll ask her, then. (Exeunt DE. and GE.. R.)

CH. 1 wonder now where 1 can find those women?

· SCENE Vl

hard, I hear.
