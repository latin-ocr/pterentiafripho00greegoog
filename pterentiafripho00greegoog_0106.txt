ol it. I propose to take some days off.

AN. Why, there 's Phormio. Say!

ΡΗ. Say what?

AN. What ’s Phaedria going to do now? how does he
propose to spend his honeymoon?

PH. He ’s going to take his turn at playing your part.
AN. What part is that?

ΡΗ. To run away srorn his father. And he requests you

fact is, he is going to my house lor a little spree. I shall
tell the old gentlemen that Ι am going down to Sunium to·
