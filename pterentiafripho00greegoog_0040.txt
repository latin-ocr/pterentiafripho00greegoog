THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

To say nothing os your having got a well-born lady without
any expense, and os having the wile ol your choice publicly
acknowledged‚ and without any scandali Here you are per-
fectly happy except for one thing, -a temper to bear it all
with equanimity. Is you had to deal with a slave-trader
like that one ol mine, then you 'd find out! But that 's the
way almost all ol us are made ; we 're dissutisfied with our ·
own lot.

AN. On the contrary, Phaedria, it seems to me that you
are the lucky man. You 're still persectly free to make up
your mind to your liking-to keep your sweetheart or
to give her up. But I, unluckily, have got into such a fix
that 1 can neither keep mine nor let her go either. But
what 's here? Is n't this Geta I'see running up this way?
it 's the very man. Oh, dear me, I’m dreadsully frightened
about the news he may be bringing! ( T hey retire up.)

SCENE 11

(Entcr GETA, hastily from the port.)

GE. You ’re done sor, Geta, unless you lind some way
out and mighty quiek! Such troubles threaten you allos
a sudden and you ’re so unprepared. I don’t see how to
dodge thern or how to get mysels out ol this fix. Our
reckless doings can't possibly be concealed any longer.

AN. (aride.) Why in the world is theman come in such
a fright?

GE. Besides, I’ ve only a minute to think of it; master ’s
close by.

AN. (aride.) What 's this trouble?

GE. Once he's heard of it, how shall l head off his iury?
