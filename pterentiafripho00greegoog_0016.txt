THE ARGUMENT

Tnnnsnnnnn nr J. B. Gnnuwouon

One Chremes had a brother Demipho,

Who wishing for some cause abroad to go,
Had lest his son young Antipho at home

At Athens, while it pleased him thus to roam.
This Chremes had a wise and daughter too

· In Lemnos domiciled‚ that no one knew;

Another one at Athens, and an heir

That desperately loved a harper fair.

From Lemnos came the mother with the maid
To AthenS, and there died. The daughter paid
The last sad rites (now Chremes was away).

And so it came about that on that day

Young Antipho the orphan child espied,

Fell deep in love and took her sor his bride

(Ἴ was through a parasite 't was brought about).

The brothers coming home with rage broke out, ·

Gave thirty minae to the parasite

To take her off and marry her outright.

With this they buy the girl that Phaedria prized‚
The other keeps his bride now recognized.
