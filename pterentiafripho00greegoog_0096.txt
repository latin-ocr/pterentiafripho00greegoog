THE PHORMlO OF TERENCE.

Where are the ladies? So. Oh, dear me! CH. Hey?
what 's the matter? are n't they alive?

So. Your daughter is; but her mother, poor thing, died
ol grief.

CH. Τοο badl

So. And so I, being only a lone lom old woman, whom
nobody knew, did my best and got the girl married to the
Ι young gentleman who lives in here.

CH. To Antipho?

So. Certainly ; the very man.

CH. What! has he got two wives?

S0. For pity's sake, no; she 's the only one he has.

CH. What about the other who is called his relative?

So. Why, it’s she, os course.

(ΖΗ. What ’s that you say?

So. It was a put-up job, —the only way by which her
lover might get her without a dowry.

CH. Heaven help us! how often things do turn out by

hauhazard which you ’d scarcely dare to wish ior! Here
I've come home and found my daughter married to the

very man Ι wanted and just as I wanted itl The very thing
that we were both trying with all our might to bring about,
he has taken the greatest trouble to do all by himself with-
out any trouble ol ours,

So, Well now, just see what 's to be done next. The
young man’s father has arrived, and they say that he is
bitterly opposed to it.

CH. There 's no danger at all. But, by heaven and
earth, don't let anybody find out that she is my daughter.

So. Nobody shall from me.

CH. Follow me; you shall hear the rest inside.
(Exeunt to DEMIPHO'S.)
