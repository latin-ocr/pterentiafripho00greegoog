THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 93

CH. (aride.) How or where did he ever come to find this
out? DE. (asida.) Idon’t know; but l’m sure I didn’t «
tell anybody.

CH. (aside.) A perfect miracle, as Ι hope to live!

PH. (asz'de.) Ι ’ve put a spoke in his wheel.

DE. See here, is this rascal going to rob us of all this

⁸ money and laugh in our very laces? By heaven, Ι 'll die the
death first! (asida to CH.) Make ready to be bold and have
your wits about you. You see your little peccadillo has got
out and you can’t hide it from your wile any longer. The
easiest way to get it forgiven, Chremes is for us to tell her
ourselves what she is sure to hear from others. And then
we shall be able to revenge ourselves at our ease upon this
dirty fellow. PH. (asida.) My goodness! I'm in a fix if 1
don't look out sor mysell. They are making at me with the
air os prize-fighters. CH. (aside.) But I’m afraid we can't
make her forgive me.

DE. (asida.) Conrage, Chremesl l'll bring you back
into her good graceS, on the strength of this, that the .
woman by whom you had this child is out os the way.

PH. That’s the way you deal with me, is it? a cunning
attack enough! lt 's not sor his good that you ’ve stirred me
up, Demipho, by heaven ! Aha! when you ’ve been carrying
on abroad after your own sweet will without any regard for
yonder noble lady, buton the contrary, insulting her in this
strange fashion, would you come now with prayers to wash
away your sin? Why, l'll set her so afire against you with
this story that you shan’t put her out though you actually
dissolve away in tears.

DE. Was ever a man so impudent! Why does n’t the

·. government transport the knave to some desert island?

CH. I'm reduced to such a state that I don’t know what
to do with him. DE. Ι du, then. Let's go to law.

, ΡΗ. To law? to lter, if you don’t mind. CH. Follow him
up; hold on to him while 1 call the slaves out.
