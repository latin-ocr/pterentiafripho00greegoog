THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

Nn. But what?

CH. There 's no need os telling.

ΡΗ. Not sor you ol course, but she ought to know. ln
Lemnos-

ΝΑ. Ahl what 's that you say?

CH. Won't you hold your tongue?

PH. Behind your back —

CH. Oh dear me!

ΡΗ. He married another wile.

Nn. God forbid, my dear man!

ΡΗ. It’s true.

Nn. Alasl I’m undonel

ΡΗ. And by her he’s already had one daughter too,
without your dreaming ol it.

Cli-*What shall 1 do?

NA. Oh heavensl what a wicked, shamelul thingl

ΡΗ. Do? you 're done lor!

Na Was there ever anything more inlamousl When it
comes to their wives, they ’re old enough, forsooth! Demi-
pho, I appeal to you, lor 1 am sick os talking to this creature.
This was the meaning, was it, os all those constant trips and
long stays at Lemnos? this was the low prices that reduced
our rents there?

DE„ For my part, Nausistrata, 1 don't say that he does n’t

” deserve to be blamed in this matter, but it is a lauit that

may be pardoned. ,

ΡΗ. Might as well talk to the dead.

DE. The lact is, it was not that he did n’t care l'or you or
that he dislilred you. His affair with this woman was
about fifteen years ago, once when he had drunlr too much,

97

and that was how this girl cameto be born; he never went ,

near the woman afterwards; she is dead and out ol the way;
that was the only stumbling-bloek lest. And so l beg ol
you that you will bear this patiently, as you act in other
things.
