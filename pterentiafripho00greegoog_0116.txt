DE. What 's to be done then?

PH. If you will give me the lady as you promised, I will
marry her; but ii you really want her to stay with you,
Demipho, why the dowry must stay with me. It is n't sair
that Ι should be the loser through the means ol you two;

other lady who was to bring rue just as large a dowry.

DE. You be hanged with your high-toned talk, you vaga·

doings? PH. You're making me angry. DE. So you’d
marry her, would you, ii we gave herto you?

her in your house; that was your scheme.

over my money. PH. Not much; you hand over my wife.

man, were you? DE. What game he 's making of us!

CH. We let you off scot free. PH. Oh, bosh! CH. Well,
what would you have? We let you off with the money that
you ’ve got. PH. Oh, yes! Why the deuce are you making
game os me with your silly, childish shilly·shallying? ‘I

λ won't, Iwill, and I will, I won't,'—one aster the other;

a bargain one minute and break it off the next.
