THE PROLOGUE

Bu J. Β. Gnaauoucu

That this to all be prospered is our prayer;
Patrons of noble arts and judges fair,

We are to act a play, a Latin one,

By Tully witnessed 3ηά by Roscius done,

The work of Terence; with such names as these
To recommend us, we must surely please.

I called it Latin, I was partly wrong;

No doubt the verses to that tongue belong;

But incidents and thought are purely Greek,

The Latin part is but the words we speak.

For just as that we call an English play

Is what some Frenchman elever in that way

Has made before ; so Romans thought no sharne
To take srorn Greece and publish in their name.
What use, then, now to offer you a play

Not even native 3ηά long past its day,

A scenic outline when in Greek 't was made,

Ι Αηά now a faded shadow os that shade?

Because while ages keep their steady pace,
The aims 3ηά nature os the human race
Continue still the same ; their sear and woe,
Their joys and their desires, no changes show.
The Latin that we speak in Grecian dress
Mirrors the nature os our age no less.

Only the outward acts and garb are old,
The rest is sresh as when 't was first unrolled. —-
