THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 41

Da. Yes sir. CRA. Ι should like to have you act sor the
interests ol your house. Now this is the way it seems to
me, it 's all right and proper that what your son has done
in your absence should be put back entirely as it was, and
you will carry that point That ’s what I say.

DE. Now, Hegio, it ’s your turn to speak.

ι ΗΕ. Ι believe that he has spoken advisedly; but this is
ἱ the way'of it ; many men ol many mindS, many birds ol
many kinds3 each man has his own point os view. Now it
· does n't seem to me that what the law has done can be
undone; and it 's discreditable to try it. DE. Well, Crito?

CRI. l vote we take time to think it over; it 's important.

HE. We can't do anything more for you, can we?

DE. You have done finely. (Exeuntadvisers,1c) I’m ἱ
much more bewildered than before. (Enter GE. srom DE.'s j
house.) GE. They say he hasn’t come in. DE. Imustwait
lor my brother. I’ll follow the advice which he gives me
in the matter. I¹ll go down to the port to find out when
he’s to come home. (Exit L.) GE. And I’ll go look
lor Antipho, so that he may know how things are. But,
holloal 1 see him coming in the nick os time.

SCENE 1v

(Enter amnuo, R.)

AN. Well, Antipho, you and your panic have much to
answer lor. The idea ol your having made off and left your
very lile in other people's keeping! Did you suppose that
others would attend to your business better than you would
yoursell Ρ Νο, no; however it was about the rest, you cer·
tainly ought to have taken care of that girl ol yours at home,
to prevent her from getting into trouble from her trust in
you. All she has and all she hopes sor, poor thing, hinge
on you alone now. ’
