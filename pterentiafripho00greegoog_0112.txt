AN. Yes, and I have had an inlrling of this story, too.
, GE. Yes, and l’ll give you something to make you be-
lieve still more. After a while your uncle came out here,
and soon aster that he went in again with your father.
They both said that you were allowed to keep her. Finally
I was sent to look you up and bring you home.

AN. Why don't you drag me off then? What are you
waiting for?

GE. I'll do it mighty quick.

AN. Good·bye‚ my dear Phormio.

ΡΗ. Good·bye‚ Antipho. God bless me, this is a good
thing. I'm glad os it.

PH. What an unexpected piece ol good luck sor these
boys! And nowI have a fine chance to take the old gen·
tlemen in, and to rid Phaedria of his worry about the money,
so that he shan’t have to beg it of any os his sellows. For
this very same money, given already, shall be his outright
in spite of all their opposition. The facts have shown me
how to soree them to it. I must now put on a new air and
change my expression. I'll withdraw into this alley close
by and show mysels to them from there when they come out.
I shan’t go to the sair as 1 pretended. (Withdraws, R.)
