THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE.

SCENE 11

(Enter GETA, R.)

GE. (asida) A shrewder sellow than Phormio 1 never
saw in my born days. Ι went to tell him that money was
wanted and how it was to be got. Ihad hardly told him
hals the story when he understood it all—began to laugh,
congratulated me, asked where the old man was. Then he
thanked heaven that now he had a chance to show that he
was as much os a friend to Phaedria as to Antipho. I told

the sellow to wait on 'Change‚ and said that Ι would bring
the old man there. Holloa! here he is. Who 's that on
the other side? Oh my! Phaedria’s father 's come home.
Lubber that Ι am, what was Ι afraid os Ρ was it because 1 ’ve

got two to trick instead os one? It's handier, Ι think, to .

have two strings to your bow. I’ll try to get the money
from the man Ι meant originally. Is he gives it, all right;

is nothing can be done with him, then I’ll attach this
newcomer.
