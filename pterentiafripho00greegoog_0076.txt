ΡΗ. What shall Ι do? where am I to find the money for
him insuch a hurry, when I've less than nothing myself,

poor fellow? lt was promised to me, if 1 could only have
begged these three days out of himl

AN. Shall we let him be made so unhappy, Geta, after
he has just helped me, as you tell me, in such a friendly
way? Why not try to return his kindness now when it ’s
needed?

(ΞΕ Ι know of course it ’s only the fair thing to do.

AN. Come, then, you are the only man who can save him.

PH. And shall another man carry her off to foreign parts
before my very eyes? Ah me! Well, then, you twa talk
to me and look your fill on me while you may, Antipho, and
while I’m here.
