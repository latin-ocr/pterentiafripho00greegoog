THE PHORMIO OF TERENCE. 37

DE. Very likely, as you say. Well, when l carne sor-
ward I should have stated how she was related to me. Now,
you do the same. Come, how is she related? GE. Bravo,
master, well done l and you, sir, look out for yoursels.

PH. My duty was to explain it to the court, and I did
so with perfect clearness. Il it was n't true, why did n’t
your son disprove it on the spot? DE. You talk to me
about my son? Why, Ι can't find words to describe his
stupidity. PH. Well, then, you who are so wise, go to the ’ἶ
magistrates and make them try the same case all over again
sor you. For you talk as though you were sole lord para·
mount in these parts and the only man alive entitled toa
second trial os the same case. .

DE. Though Ι have been unjustly treated, still, rather
than go to law or have to listen to you—here, just as if
she really were related, take these five ducats, the -dowry
that the law directs, and carry her away.

PH. Ha! ha! ha! you sweety! DE. What's the matter?
there 's nothing wrong in my demand, is there? arn I not κ
to get the benefit ol what is the law os the land? ·

ΡΗ. Does the law direct you, I’d like to know, to pay ’
her and send her off like a courtesan? Or was it to prevent
a freeborn lady from doing anything to disgrace herself ἵ
through poverty that the law directs to give her to her
nearest kinsman to live with him? and that ’s just what
you 're preventing.

Du. YeS, to her nearest kinsman. But how do we come
in, oron what grounds? ΡΗ. Oh, dear! ‘don’t open a case
that ’s closed,' as the saying goes. DE. Don't open it? on
the contrary, Ι 'll never rest until Ι ’ve seen it through.

ΡΗ. Silly os you. DE. You just let me alone.

ΡΗ. In short, Demipho,I've nothing to do with you. It
was your son that lost the suit, not you; sor your. time lor

DE. You can take-him as saying all' that 1.³sayn0w;
